# Git Display

###### darthnater007

----------

This is a work currently in progress.

I want to build a simple display that grabs information from git and displays it in a system window:
	- what branch I'm on
	- what other branches exist locally
	- what branches exist remotely
	- how many commits ahead/behind of master I am
	- files that contain changes currently
	- maybe more?
